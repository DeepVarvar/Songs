Lyrics

I like coding in C

Vi is my bestfriend

A prompt is all I need

I don't have any breakpoints


I use external library

I know what are make files

I don't know what OO means

CVS cares of my files


Coding everyday

Coding everynight

With a mug of coffee

In a room with no lights

Coding everyday

Coding everynights

Programming is my life...


I'm all into REGEX

I love WGET to

Bourne Again Sheel is my best

My licence use GNU


I don't know web 2.0

Facebook and Flickr suck

What the hell is django

Who said that ruby rocks?


Coding everyday

Coding everynight

With a mug of coffee

In a room with no lights

Coding everyday

Coding everynights

Programming is my life...
